msg: <p>Why monkeypatch when you can patch? :-) mqext already adds the main repo's
  qparent and qtip to the commit messages automatically, so you can exactly recover
  any past state more easily. Adding on the current queue would totally fit in, and
  I would have no objection to it happening all the time.</p>
