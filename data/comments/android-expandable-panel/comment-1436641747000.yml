msg: '<p>I am trying to implement your ExpandablePanel and it nearly works. The only
  Problem: The handle-Widget is not displayed. Tried several widgets like ImageView
  or Button in die ExpandablePanel and they are displayed until I declare one being
  ''handle'' (via android:id="@id/handle"). What could be the problem?<br>EDIT: Everything
  is initialized the correct way. mHandle and mContent are set with the right values
  in ExpandablePanel (after debugging the process).</p>'
