msg: "I'm a Mozilla enthusiast, long-time occasional bug reporter, tester, etc.\r\n\r\nI keep thinking: keybase.io is an open-source, independent chat app with a good security/data privacy story. It has a friendly UI, and seems relatively free of corporate gotchas, a rare combination.\r\n\r\nAm I crazy for thinking this should be the app of choice for software teams which are skeptical of Slack for whatever reason/don't find it a  good fit?\r\n\r\nI know this is a weird thing to ask on a personal blog, rather than an official Mozilla channel. But honest,y much of this discussion around replacing IRC is publicly happening via blog posts. I am also on a team that uses Slack, and I wonder why we don't use something like keybase.io instead.\r\n\r\nThere is also Matrix, which is a lot like IRC, just newer and, if I recall correctly, provides standard ways of securing data, and/or keeping it private. The puri.sm folks seem to like it, and they're pretty intense about the free/libre ethos, so maybe that's another option? It has most of the downsides from a UX perspective that IRC has, like being a very nerdy, text-focused product with no one client GUI app to rule them all. It does have most of IRC's upsides too: decentralized, open standard, bring your own client (including web clients)... Interoperability with existing chat standards...\r\n\r\nSo I humbly suggest either keybase.io for more of Slack's UI polish/charm, but geekier and less centralized/corporate. Or Matrix for a relatively 1:1 (feature-and-UX-similar), modern IRC replacement."
