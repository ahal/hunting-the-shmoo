msg: "Hi! This is a fantastic blog post and I quoted several points you made about Mozilla's communication style at <https://github.com/good-labs/slopi-communication/issues/22>\r\n\r\nI'd love to find something under mozilla.org about Mozilla's communication style, especially with regard to decision making happening in the open and being logged or otherwise record in public places (you mentioned Bugzilla and IRC logs, for example).\r\n\r\nAndrew, can you please help me find a reference? Thanks again for this great blog post!"
