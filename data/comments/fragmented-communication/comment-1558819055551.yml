msg: "@Philip\r\n\r\nHi, and thanks! I'm not aware of any official stance or documentation\
  \ with regards to public record keeping. It's just how it's always been and many\
  \ of us old-timers just take it for granted (though as you might tell from this\
  \ post, in recent years it's been less like this).\r\n\r\nThe logbot site I linked\
  \ is a side project from a Mozilla employee, and I believe the older logs have been\
  \ saved and passed on from Mozillians who ran logging scripts back in the day. I\
  \ share your belief that having publicly indexed logs is benecifial. Hopefully we'll\
  \ continue to have this ability with whatever replaces IRC."
