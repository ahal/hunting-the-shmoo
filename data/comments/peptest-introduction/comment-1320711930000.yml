msg: "<p>Great post, Andrew, thanks for all your hard work here.\_ I wanted to add\
  \ that Andrew is also working with Release Engineering to get this test harness\
  \ turned on for Tryserver first.\_ This way, we will give the developers the ability\
  \ to try out tests with the new harness before we land it on other trees. (This\
  \ gives us the ability to do a find/fix cycle on the harness before putting it on\
  \ a tree and considering it \"live\".) </p>"
