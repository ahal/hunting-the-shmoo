msg: <p>This sounds neat.</p><p>However describing it as git-like seems a little misleading;
  git's branches are literally just pointers to commits. The main difference between
  git and mercurial here is that the git command line seems to be well-designed to
  work with branches, but the hg one is not to work with bookmarks.</p><p>I also have
  some philosophical issues about the use of phases here (and in general); it seems
  to me that they are more confusing than helpful ("I pushed to bitbucket and now
  my branch is empty!"). On the other hand I understand that's The Mercurial Way.</p>
