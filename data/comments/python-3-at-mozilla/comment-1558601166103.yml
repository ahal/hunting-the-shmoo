msg: "Thank you for such an in-depth article. I found it because I'm building Firefox for Windows on my machine for the first time. I had python installed, but during installation I saw a message \"Your python version 2.7 is new enough\", so I guess python 2 was sometime during the process described on `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites`\r\n\r\nDo you know where python 2 could have been installed, and what needs to be done so that new contributors on Windows started with python 3?"
