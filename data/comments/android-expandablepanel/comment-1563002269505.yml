msg: "In December, I got my nails вЂњdippedвЂќ for the first time with Nexgen. The con is that now, I have to go every 2-3 weeks and have them вЂњdoneвЂќ, but the pro is that they look amazing all.the.time. There is no chipping, peeling, etc. I took them off for a week in January thinking I would just go back to doing them myself, but I immediately had them dipped again because I missed it.  \r\n<a href=http://flakynails.cf/art/flaky-nails/>Flaky nails</a>"
