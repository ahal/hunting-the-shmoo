msg: <p>Thanks for sharing!</p><p>I have been using this workflow for about a year
  now and can report that rebase extension is not very helpful when conflicts arise.
  This makes bookmark workflow comfortable for short-lived patches. Whenever you changeset
  lives long enough to race with somebody else's work you will have hard times keeping
  up with central. rebase would live you with a bunch of .rej files without hinting
  where the merge broke. This problems might affect changesets that touch many things.
  To my experience using mq in such situations is more comfortable.</p>
