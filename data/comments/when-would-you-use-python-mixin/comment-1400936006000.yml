msg: <p>A good example of mixins in Python would be the "<a href="http://collections.abc"
  rel="nofollow noopener" title="collections.abc">collections.abc</a>" module in the
  standard library. For example, if you implement __getitem__() and __len__() then
  inherit from collections.abc.Sequence, you automatically get implementations of
  __contains__(), __iter__(), __reversed__(), index() and count() methods. If you
  used composition, you would have to manually define each of those methods to call
  the equivalent method on your internal Sequence object, which is certainly possible
  but also pretty tedious.</p>
