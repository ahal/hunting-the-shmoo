msg: <p>But using composition you can use an instance of an object that uses reflection
  to get members, and call _its_ toJSON() method. This also allows you to use dependency
  injection, making it easier to test the code using a mock object and to use different
  types of object to implement toJSON(). This more flexible approach loosens coupling
  and makes designs more readily adaptable.</p>
