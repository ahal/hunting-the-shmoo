msg: <p>Definitely :). Good documentation goes a long way, but unfortunately good
  documentation is often a luxury. With composition it is easy to see which attributes
  come from which class by reading the code, there is no ambiguity. It is also easy
  for a small number of mixins. But when a class has 3+ mixins, it becomes a real
  pain to hunt down which attributes belong to which mixins.</p>
