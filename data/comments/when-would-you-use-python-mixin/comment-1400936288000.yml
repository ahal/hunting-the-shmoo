msg: <p>Depends on your need, not always coding is a perfect abstraction of reality.
  Classes and objects don't always represent real world entities with real world relationships.</p><p>I've
  found myself using mixins to extend funcionality, to provide base classes. I use
  Django a lot and using Forms, Views, Admin classes, mixins are a great tool to have.
  When having a set of related views, if you know the methods you can just write your
  own and a few helpers and save yourself a lot of coding just by defining classes
  that inherit from framework provided classes and your mixins, declare a couple of
  class attributes as configuration and be good to go.</p>
