Hey! Check it out, I have crash stacks in my [logs][1] now!  I know, I know, I took my sweet time.
I'm sorry. I hope this doesn't damage our relationship. Is there anything I can do to make it up to
you? I want to help. I really do. It's just. I don't know. I guess I've been feeling under the
weather lately. I must have caught a [bug][2].

Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I'm still here for you. I'm trying to make things right
again. I just hope that one day, we'll be able to trust each other.  I look forward to working more
closely with you in the future, and beyond.

Sincerely,  
B2G Emulator Tests
