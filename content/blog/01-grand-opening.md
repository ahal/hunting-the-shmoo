Back in high school and throughout most of my University career, I've always thought that personal blogs were dumb. Who in their right mind would care what *I* was up to?
It wasn't until I started interning at Mozilla that my views started to shift. I began seeing them as tools to communicate new ideas and elicit feedback from anyone
interested in what you have to say. It also wasn't until I started interning at Mozilla that I realized that I actually *might* have something interesting to say.
So here I am, creating a blog with one month left in my second internship. Too little too late? Maybe, but I have to start at some point.

This website is created with Django, and the blogging engine is using the [django-articles][1] project.
While django-articles is an awesome little app that has saved me tons of time (and I'd highly recommend it), there is one question that I keep asking myself.
Why didn't I just use wordpress? I could have been done in a matter of hours instead of days, I'd have more features at my disposal and I could probably
find a better theme for my site as I am most definitely not a designer. One theory that I have is that I'm a masochist. But I think it may be some combination of the
following:

* Personal learning
* Django experience as my group and I are using it for a school project
* Complete control over every aspect of the site
* It *was* kind of fun
* Wordpress is popular and I'm a wannabe hipster

Anyway, this website is still very much under construction and I know there are many parts that aren't finished yet
(for example it looks like crap if your browser doesn't support border-radius). I hope to clean it up a bit and add some meaningful content in the next month or so.
