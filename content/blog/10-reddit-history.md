Sometimes I'd remember this awesome thing that I saw on Reddit awhile back and want to share it with
someone. I'd try to find it through browser history or reddit search, but I wasn't usually
successful. Reddit search isn't very good and I use Reddit *a lot* so my browser history for
reddit.com is huge and unwieldy.

So in my spare time I decided to write [Reddit History][1]. It basically just keeps track of all the
submissions you've viewed, and lets you filter them by sub-reddit and text search (regex).

Reddit History is available as both a [userscript][2] (also works in Chrome with Tampermonkey) and
[Firefox extension][3].
